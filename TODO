1. Handle record larger than batch size
2. SerializingSelector
3. Matching requests to responses...

Notes
- Should the client api take objects or bytes?
- Partitioner should also take raw bytes

Issues
- Client-driven topic creation...
- What if node host/port changes dynamically
- Ensure client shutdown waits on all data being sent
- Sender may be unfair in selecting topic/partitions
