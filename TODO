Thoughts
- Should the client api take objects or bytes?
- Partitioner should also take raw bytes?
- Move non-public classs in public packages to an "internals" package?

Issues
- Client-driven topic creation...
- What if node host/port changes dynamically
- Sender may be unfair in selecting topic/partitions

TODO
- Integrate into main code base
- Reconsider bootstrap
- Metrics
- Flesh out unit tests
- Deeper perf testing
- Compression
- Retries
- Optimize serialization
- Handle acks=0

Discussion points
- Configuration
- Serialization
- Readiness criteria
- Logging: log4j vs slf4j vs jul
- Code layout/packages
