Thoughts
- Should the client api take objects or bytes?
- Partitioner should also take raw bytes?
- Move non-public classs in public packages to an "internals" package?

Issues
- Client-driven topic creation...
- What if node host/port changes dynamically
- Sender may be unfair in selecting topic/partitions
